                But also let's hear it from the star of the night:
            </p>
            <p class="text-n">
                The following is brought to you by ChatGPT 4o.</p>
            <p class="i-subtitle">What’s new with GPT‑5?</p>
            <p class="i-subtitle">Major upgrade across the board</p>
            <p class="text-n">OpenAI introduces GPT‑5 as a smarter, faster, more accurate model that significantly
                outperforms GPT‑4 and previous versions in coding, writing, reasoning, and even health-related
                inquiries.
            </p>
            <p class="i-subtitle">A unified model with multi-tiered intelligence</p>
            <p class="text-n">Instead of choosing between models, GPT‑5 automatically routes your prompt to the most
                appropriate variant. For simpler queries, a lightweight version (like “mini” or “nano”) handles it; for
                tougher, more complex tasks, it engages a deeper reasoning variant known as “GPT‑5 thinking” .
            </p>
            <p class="i-subtitle">Smarter pricing and tiers</p>
            <p class="text-n">There are multiple variants to suit different needs and budgets—from GPT‑5 (standard), to
                GPT‑5 mini (cost-efficient), and GPT‑5 nano (ultra-fast and budget-friendly). Free users get access with
                lower usage caps; Plus and Pro users enjoy higher limits and even more capabilities.
            </p>
            <p class="i-subtitle">Multimodality & agentic abilities</p>
            <p class="text-n">GPT‑5 handles text, images, potentially audio — plus it's excellent at chaining together
                actions (tool calls), planning, and coding. One demo had it build a full website with frontend UI in
                minutes—planning, scaffolding, coding, building, summarizing, and suggesting next steps autonomously.
            </p>
            <p class="i-subtitle">Enhanced safety & real-world performance</p>
            <p class="text-n">OpenAI claims GPT‑5 lowers hallucination rates by a significant margin and improves
                reliability, especially in domains like health and finance. Safeguards are in place to help the model
                gracefully handle tasks it cannot solve.
