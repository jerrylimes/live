        <p class="text-n">
            A man in a plaid shirt and jeans stood in front of a desk.</p>
        <p class="text-n">“Before we begin today’s session, I’d like us all to try to recall -”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">He turned to draw a little question mark on the blackboard.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“The first question we’ve ever asked in our entire lives.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">And he added a little circle around the question mark. Then he stepped away from the desk and
            started strolling around the room. “Now, I know for most of us, the first thing that comes to mind would be
            a lot of ‘why’s. But is there something other than that ‘why’? Or what triggered us to understand the logic
            behind that thing we didn’t understand when we were little?”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">It took me some minutes before finally tracing back a memory lane that wasn’t a dead-end
            street. I think I might be four or five then.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“That’s a news reporter, Jerry.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Does he sell balloons?”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“No.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“He should try selling balloons. They are really popular.”

        <p class="i-subtitle">A Wanderer’s Journal</p>
        <p class="text-n">By my last day in San Francisco, I had visited the places and faces I had planned for my trip
            to California, and my afternoon was surprisingly free. My dad had been to the United States once and told me
            about Fisherman’s Wharf and the Golden Gate. I had heard about the latter myself repeatedly – one of the
            countless hallmarks of America.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">The whole trip felt like walking into the sweetest dreams I’ve had in my life. Los Angeles had
            been legendary, just like the legends about it. To this day I don’t know what I did to deserve the sunset at
            Griffith Observatory and reuniting with old-timey acquaintances. I asked my headphones to play Lana Del Rey
            nonstop for days, and they gladly obeyed. My loved ones always say I’m a simple kid. Send me off to an
            interesting place and provide me with basic housing and nutrition, and I’ll be smiling ear to ear. The place
            has to be interesting, though: it’s unlikely I’ll see myself joyfully going through my days at somewhere
            embroiled with stress and uneasiness.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">On that bright-colored afternoon, I thought my phone and I could make it to the Golden Gate
            through public transit. Didn’t fully move on from the convenience of Metro LA, I guess. I took multiple
            turns, got to a bus stop, and waited for half an hour. The bus, as I had expected, never came. These cities’
            bus schedules never really accord with what Google Maps says. I was halfway to the destination and thought
            maybe the Uber would be cheaper now that I’ve spent all this time walking around aimlessly. I pulled out my
            phone. It wasn’t, still $12. The driver kindly dropped me off at a vast park for a better view, which I
            later learned is the Fort Point National Historic Site. I opened the car door and walked into the sea salt
            air and cool gushes of wind.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">It was March 14th. Springtime was dancing on her heels, glittering with chills. People were
            gathering around the fences that kept them safe from the ocean’s grip, some were fishing. That’s what a
            normal guy would say; what I saw was – and pardon me for sounding dramatic – the austere men and women
            standing in their unblemished white gowns between soft and glowing heaven clouds, and the sunlight was
            hugging everyone close. Even taking a step felt surreal at that moment.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">The waves became louder as I approached their accepting arms. I finally came to an extension
            bridge that stretches a little further into the ocean, and stood there. Snow or even sand was nowhere in
            sight, but I swear I saw Joel Barish and Clementine Kruczynski tugging each other.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">And I thought, boy, I could die here. I’ve never felt more loved. More helpless yet worriless.
            I know I have unfinished studies and unfinished business, but I was subdued and I issued them an apology. I
            need to be buried. Under these waves or afloat like a little buoy. I wasn’t just smiling ear to ear anymore,
            I was fulfilled to the very best. Not like I ever thought this moment of fulfillment and ultimate pleasure
            could last or anything, instead I very much prepared myself for its termination. But for that afternoon, it
            didn’t. I was wafting through memories and familiar faces I travelled hundreds of miles to see days earlier,
            how most of them never really changed and became my savior or secret crush.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">Then like the waves, the image of them became pellucid and collapsed into the distance. I was
            there, alone but still delighted.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I walked along the Historic Site, my head playing Everything I Wanted by Billie Eilish on
            repeat. In an interview, she said she had a nightmare where she jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge and the
            news came out the next day with the headline “Annoying Girl Finally Killed Herself.” (Again, pardon me for
            not remembering her exact words correctly.) Everybody who saw the news cheered. She woke up and decided to
            write the song, but what she conceived was initially sandboxed due to its darkness. On an information board
            erected somewhere near the Fort Point, from 2000 to 2005, every two weeks, a person jumps off the bridge.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I was more sad than appalled to see this statistic. For so many of us, life has been the
            antithesis of easy, and the world has been the opposite of kind. We need to let a lot go. The world sucks,
            so keep in mind that we can suck too. Let’s be less harsh on ourselves than people who know nothing about
            us.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">As I walked back, I felt compelled to document all of this. It felt so real and tangible as
            long as it was not written down. I have the pictures, I said to myself. It’s been delineated in the back of
            my mind, so I’ll let it stay that way.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">Want to hear something fun? In my wanderer’s journal, I have kept all the pictures from my
            trip to California, all except my afternoon spent at the Golden Gate.

        <hr>

        <p class="i-subtitle">Excision</p>
        <p class="text-n">
            I think someone barged into my room last night. Saxophone-shaped device in one hand, a pipette in another,
            he was standing in a long white coat that would’ve looked completely normal if it wasn’t covering his
            abnormally huge calloused hands and his intimidating torso. He’s probably the type of man you see on the
            streets and immediately want to walk away from. I know I would.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">Then he pointed the saxophone-shaped device at my unconscious, cold body on the bed. He was
            visibly trembling as if this were his first time. He slid the pipette into his pocket and positioned both
            his hands on the saxophone. In the silence of the night, he softly blew into the sax and started playing
            Waltz II from The Suite for Jazz Orchestra No. 2. One of my favorites.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">Just as he was about to finish, I yawned and pulled the sheets up over my head. Turning
            around, I noticed the music playing from the side of my bed had stopped, and a tall figure was looming over
            me.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">And I mumbled, “Hey, you.” Then I fell asleep.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">But he didn’t leave. There was about an hour where he probably just watched me sleep like a
            psychopath, according to the security camera footage. Then he finally lost his patience and grabbed my hand.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Hey. Wake the hell up, buddy. You said you’d help me move out, remember?”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I pulled my hand back from his suffocating grip. “I did. I also checked the time, and it
            appears to be 02:40 in the morning. Let’s take you to a hospital because clearly some meds need to be
            taken.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“I know. I just couldn’t sleep. Come on, it’ll be fun.” His smile in the dark looked like a
            smirk.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“You do know I just called you a psycho, right?”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">On a hot and humid summer night, he pulled me into his car.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Why would you need me to help you anyway?” I closed the car door and fastened the seatbelt.
            “You’re like the fittest person I’ve ever met. I’m the opposite. We’re not close friends. We probably aren’t
            even friends. We only meet in my dreams.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Exactly.” He started the engine, and we veered off into the street.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“I’m gonna sue you someday.” I rolled my eyes.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">We got to his place at 03:17. Boy, when I tell you his place looked every bit like what I had
            in mind – a hot mess, a fluorescent junkyard, a combination of lamenting juxtapositions. I reasonably
            loathed it because someone once told me I was, quote, “too tidy to be a boy.” Oh, wait, that’s him. He told
            me that.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Did you even start packing?” I refused to step inside and slapped my forehead in dismay.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">He shook his head.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Do you know what packing means?”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">He sneered. “Of course I do.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Ok then. Tell me what it means.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">He just pointed to a pile of collapsed cardboard boxes on top of all this obscenity like an
            ogre.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I had to scream so I did. “I’m not doing this, bro. You can look me straight in my eyes and
            tell me you’re gay and you want to fuck me and I’m still walking away from this room.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">An inquisitive look swept his face. “What if I – ”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“I’d be walking away regardless. Now – ” I walked to a corner of pizza boxes. “Send these to
            Joey Tribbiani or the garbage bins downstairs. These books here – oh god, you actually know how to read?” I
            was, indeed, shocked to my very core.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">He rolled his eyes. “I mean, that’s news. Mr. Reed knows how to read. Anyways, these books
            here are seemingly related to your major, which I assume would be biology?” I looked at him and he nodded.
            “Very well then. All biology books should be in a box, and all the other books – ” I walked around the room,
            sidestepping suspicious boxes of dark unknown, “ – are nonexistent. So. How about you put the books away
            first, and we work on the next category, which is…” Trying to find a pattern in the tumultuous room, I
            finally said, “clothes.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">He collected the books, and I sat there doing nothing except making commands. When asked about
            why, I answered simply, “The choice of inviting an out-of-shape friend at 2 a.m. to help pack for someone
            who should be able to lift me in a gym is a questionable one, so much so that it’s in much more dire need to
            be justified than my idleness.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">When we were finally done, I asked a question that I never knew needed to be asked.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Where do you put all these boxes?”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“At your place.” He looked down at me.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">My jaw dropped. “I don’t have a place.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Well, then, at your parents’ place.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">My jaw continued dropping. I stared at his stupid face blankly. “Did you, by any chance, get
            hit by a fucking car?”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“No.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Because I really need you to be. What do you fucking mean? How in the world would my parents
            even agree?”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“I talked with them.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I knew I blushed, and I was starting to lose consciousness. “You talked with my parents about
            storing your shit at their place and they said yes?”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Yes.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Ok then. When my parents wake up this morning, I hope they won’t be surprised at this surge
            of boxes around their house, because if they do, you’re definitely going behind bars.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">On the drive home, I started getting sleepy but managed to be sober enough to ask the two most
            important questions that I require an answer to.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I turned to him. “Tell me something, Reed. Why do you always come to me for stuff like this?”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“What do you mean?” He kept his eyes on the road.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Like appearing in my dreams and distorting all the things we’ve actually done together. You
            know you don’t trust me with your stuff. You know tonight has been my fabrication.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">There was a moment of silence. “I don’t know… I mean, it is your subconscious. So you’d
            probably know the answer before I do.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“You’d think, wouldn’t you?” I uttered in exhaustion.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Will you ever leave me alone? Please? For my sanity?”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">Our car arrived at my parents’ house. “That’s overblown. How does my presence equal your
            insanity?”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“It does. I met you four years ago. This is the fifth time I’ve written about you in my
            compositions. You’ve come to me in my sleep for, I don’t know, twenty times now. You’re not gay. I had a
            major secret crush on you, and now we’re on different coasts.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“You did?” He said as we felt the elevator accelerate.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Yes. I never told anyone except people who don’t judge me. They probably do judge me, but let
            them be.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I unlocked the door and we tiptoed back to my room. “Seriously, Reed. I kept myself
            tongue-tied because I knew telling the truth would ruin both of our lives. But can you at least let me get
            over this before I actually feel the need to love somebody?”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">He walked to the side of my bed and pulled out a little cup and a test tube filled with what
            appeared to be syrup. He took out the pipette and transferred a portion of the syrup from the tube to the
            cup. He sighed.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“I don’t know. It’s not like I can control what and who you dream about. But drink this.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I looked at the cup. “Listen, Reed, if I was found dead shortly after this – ”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“It’s not poison, okay?”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I drank it. “It’s something I made for you that would probably help.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Thanks.” I looked outside. Gently but surely, light is gathering and brightening the sky.
            “It’s getting late. The day is dawning. I guess, uh, I’ll see you around. Not here, though.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Thank you for helping me move out. Goodbye!”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">He slid the pipette into his pocket and, locating his sax that was lying against the wall,
            positioned both his hands on the saxophone. In the silence of the dawn, he took a deep breath.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I was on the bed, eyes closed, fatigued, waiting for the sound of Waltz II. But nothing
            happened. As I turned around, I slowly opened my eyes.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">He was gone.</p>
        <hr>

        <p class="i-subtitle">The Tunnel</p>
        <p class="text-n">I’ve never set foot on the floor of the movie theater on Seminole Trail again since the
            evening of July 25, 2025. The shaky silhouette of me wading into the subway station, each step with less
            stability, into the hot, penetrating downpour probably drew quizzical glances from passers-by, but I
            couldn’t care less.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">And was the movie great, you may ask? Yes. It was breathtakingly fabulous. Was it to my
            liking? No, it wasn’t. I, however, didn’t come to this conclusion until hours later. At that moment, my top
            priority was to throw up somewhere in the dark.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">This shouldn’t be a hard task for anyone with the last shred of sanity. Especially since I was
            already at the gate of the subway station. I drew the umbrella and sent myself drifting down the escalator,
            past the turnstile, and into the toilet.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">It was at this moment that I started to regain my sight, which I later regret deeply. I was
            previously feeling my way through everything, the rushing crowds, the signs, the screen doors. When I
            finally washed my mouth and lifted my head from the sink, I was relieved to see that I was in the correct
            bathroom, but that relief terminated when I sensed that my surroundings were unusually dark. The only
            illumination of the bathroom came from the door that I had just entered. A door that, tarnished and
            old-fashioned, led to a dimly lit tunnel. The tunnel took a turn right some distance from where I stood,
            discouraging any guesses of where it ends.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">And I said to myself, you’re 18. This is a subway station. What could possibly go wrong?
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">As it turned out, a lot. I started walking down the tunnel, occasionally glancing back to
            ensure that my worst fear hadn’t been realized yet, and as the tunnel directed, I took a right turn.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">Why of course, more tunnel. Heaving breaths, exhaling air of uncertain and incrementing fear,
            I started walking faster, trying to memorize safety precautions for handling situations like this but soon
            realized there were none. Interestingly, the lighting of the tunnel is improving lamp by lamp, changing from
            warm to fluorescent. The moist disseminating from the bathroom was long gone, and in its place was the scent
            of nothing. Orange bricks embellished by strings of legumes become cleared and polished, packaged tighter to
            each other to form an actual wall, paler and paler. My sandals were wet from the downpour, but the squidgy
            noises they made on the floor were gradually replaced with deeper and softer thuds. The same legume-covered
            floor gave way to hard metal one-piece floorboards, cleaned and straightened.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I smelled petroleum. Then mint. I saw handles. Then top-to-bottom windows showcasing an
            aircraft, beaming lights under the night sky. I heard voices. Then the suitcases with their wheels running
            across the carpet.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">The tunnel, no longer a tunnel, took a final left turn, and I saw shadows of men and women
            with their luggage heading toward a door. I was already running at this point, fear tumbling down on me like
            a mouse under a microscope.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Am I in the - ” I was thrown off by a loudspeaker over my head.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“China Airlines. Flight CA818 from Washington to Beijing has arrived at gate C8. Passengers on
            this flight will find their baggage on carousel number 2. Good evening and good night.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I looked around in panic. I was, sure enough, in Beijing. Signs were bilingual with Simplified
            Chinese in large font, people were talking in a language that requires no subconscious processing, no one
            looked like an exotic species, and the deodorant or perfume or something no longer smelled like lime.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I was home. 2 months early. And though when this dawned on me, I was so exhilarated I felt the
            need to throw up again, I was trembling because there was no damn way I would leave a 2-month blank on all
            my studies. Even two days seemed abysmal.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">So I turned and started walking hurriedly back to gate C8. There were officers and attendants
            assisting some elders with their inquiries, so I figured a rush would help me make it through. I was
            radically optimistic: the assistance paused, and two hands blocked me from going any further into the gate.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Sir, one-way corridor! One! Way! 单行！” One of the attendants, apparently Chinese, thought
            language barrier was the reason I attempted to neglect the “No Entry” sign.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Ma’am, no, you don’t understand. I have to go back, I have unfinished stu-”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">She let go, but so did the floor. I remember falling off what most likely was Terminal 3 of
            Beijing Capital International Airport and experiencing weightlessness for the longest time in my entire
            life.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I woke up on my bed in a dark room that was my dorm room. I am certain about this, reader, for
            I could hear my roommate’s soft breathing on the other side of the room.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">Slowly climbing down my bed, I picked up my phone. 03:54. Worst time to wake up from a
            nightmare.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">In the pitch dark, I opened the Maps app, and if there is one lesson I learned that night,
            it’s this:
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">There’s no movie theater on Seminole Trail, no subway in Charlottesville, and I just gave up
            my only chance of going back to my sweet, now coveted home on the other side of Earth.

        <p class="text-n">
            He put on his glasses and flipped over my resume. He scanned through the crammed lines searching for any
            entry that was remotely close to impressive, which I’m sure didn’t take long because when I looked up again,
            his glasses were on the table.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">He looked at me in dead silence, blinked once, and said,
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Have you always been this dull?”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I froze in my seat. “Oh. Sir, I’m sure I have been and still am constantly trying to step out
            of my comfort zone and explore new stuff, like learning about the decision tree algorithms and seeking
            innovative methods of improving the -”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“No. I don’t want that crap.” Sparks of suspicion were flickering in his eyes that were locked
            on my dumbfounded face. “Look at me closely and tell me, have you always been this dull?”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I chuckled dryly and swallowed. “Sir, I’m not quite sure what that means.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Well,” he pointed at my resume, now a lifeless piece of paper lying on his table, “you
            clearly have been doing research on what you - ” he waved an airquote – “‘wanted’ – to do research on.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“I did want to do research on those topics. I’m being sincere right here right now, sir.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">He looked less intense but more suspicious. “Let’s say you are. But surely there were times
            when you imagined you could be doing something else, right? Something - ” His face suddenly lit up with the
            slightest joy and his right hand did a little dance – “cool?”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“I think this stuff is cool.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">He was unrelenting. “Were there times when you secretly wished that instead of being in a lab
            or sitting in front of a workstation, you could be playing video games?”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“No, sir.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Playing football?”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“No, sir.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Chatting with friends?”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“No, sir.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Drinking?”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“No, sir.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Hanging out at a club?”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“No, sir.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Lies!!” He suddenly hollered and slammed the table. “Do you mean to tell me that when you
            were a teenager, you never hoped to do any of the cool stuff above, not even for once?”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I stood up. I couldn’t take any of this anymore. “Sir, now that I think about it, you couldn’t
            be more correct. I am dull and unimaginative – in fact, arguably the dullest and most unimaginative in the
            entire human race.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I laughed hysterically. “I have never touched any sport for years, never played video games
            since the day I was born, never really been in any type of relationship with anyone, never drank, never
            smoked, never broken any law or regulations, not even hidden ones, never touched a comic book, never used a
            swear word, never – never -”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I was finally caught up with my speech, sweat flying over my forehead. “Sir, I could go as far
            as to say that I loathe your exemplification of ‘cool stuff’. I never wanted to do them. In fact, my
            childhood dream is to work in a cubicle, when – when everyone all around me wanted to be astronauts or
            superheroes. That’s why I’m here, honestly, because I wanted what seemed bare minimum or dull in others’
            eyes. And now, even cubicles don’t seem within reach anymore. I truly believe there are so many candidates
            who meet what you’re looking for in this job, and they drench themselves in that ‘cool stuff’ every day. I’m
            not one of them, and I’m unimpressive and unqualified.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">He looked shocked. “I -”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Good day, sir.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I turned and closed the door.</p>
        <hr>

        <p class="i-subtitle">Haneda</p>
        <p class="text-n">
            We were feet away from the waters of Tokyo Bay. No infants were present in my cabin, but I did hear someone
            moaning while asleep. I was just grateful to be on that flight, honestly. Sitting by the window, getting a
            small cup of Häagen-Dazs after every meal, and having a touchscreen in front of my economy class seat feels
            like a wonderful flight to me.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">One thing was missing here, though. My grades.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">At this point, all of us had forgotten about the ups and downs of our first semester at the
            university, and we were really just looking forward to the 25-day winter break, the shortest I’ve ever had.
            It’s weird how ever since I went abroad, every period of time was accurately measured, and I count my days
            like I count my fingers. And it’s not just me. I’ve seen people buying whiteboards specifically to count
            down the days left in a semester.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I’ve always loved to question my decision-making, and I used to think I was the only one who
            did that. Recently, however, I learned that no one under the age of 18 is capable of saying “I thought it
            all through.” Everyone is waiting for something to end just to see if that one night when they claimed to be
            “better off studying abroad” didn’t ruin their lives. That is, everyone who does not have immense wealth and
            can abort any process in life just like pressing the Control and C keys in a Terminal, or does not live in a
            bizarro world.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">So hanging myself tight to a pendulum that sways between anxiety and depression, I was not
            entirely upbeat that whole flight. People have been awfully nice to me, telling me not to be too harsh on
            myself. Jesus Christ, when did they start doing that? Where was that sentiment *before* I turned 18? Also,
            would they remain cheerful when their hard work led to below-average pay?
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">Our plane kept twirling slowly under an orange sky. I must say that for someone who has never
            been to Japan but has been exposed to their comics, it’s nice to see the cityscape of Tokyo when it’s not
            blown up by some villains, or fools, or monsters. That probably applies to every city in the world, now that
            I think about it. My window was a little smudged, but I could clearly see the water caressing the
            coastlines, and the jam-packed buildings growing taller as they accumulated in the center of the islands.
            Every tiny bit of the land was polished in gleaming gold as the sun bid adieu to the horizon.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I was still worrying, by the way. The delicacy outside the window had nothing to do with my
            mind. So were my friends, apparently, because the second we found our gate for the connecting flight from
            Tokyo to Beijing, we pulled out our laptops. And that’s when we found out the Wi-Fi in Tokyo Haneda
            International Airport sucks. Either that or maybe our school’s Student Information System sucks.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">As we were about to board, my two friends’ laptops finally replied back. Mine, however, was
            just not loading anything. Did you know that anxiety makes people thirsty? I guess I didn’t, otherwise I
            would have tried to bring a card with me to buy a bottle of water because for some reason, that was the only
            type of payment method vending machines in Haneda accepted.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">So with the same unadulterated worriment I boarded the flight home. Our plane started spinning
            around the runways again, making sure I took photos of the skyline of Tokyo at dusk that could have been
            better if the left wing of the aircraft hadn’t obstructed everything.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I was heading home, and this time, I wasn’t dreaming.
        </p>
        <hr>

        <p class="i-subtitle">Rice</p>
        <p class="text-n">To an extent, I share the sentiment of exhaustion with my professor in the spring
            semester. His annotations on slides, drawings on the chalkboard, and office hours were all like parts of an
            unsolved jigsaw puzzle that, while exuding a sense of tiredness that I personally connected with, may or may
            not have contributed to his Rate My Professor score. Life is exciting when you take his course: you don’t
            know if he’s really sitting in the office during office hours, and you shouldn’t be surprised if you sit in
            front of an empty podium for 40 minutes just to receive an email saying class is cancelled because he
            couldn’t make it.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">For the record, I do not condemn any of this at all. I fear that if, by any chance, I
            became a professor or a teacher, this is exactly how I would behave like as well. I’ve been late to anything
            in my life, delivering unsatisfying results in exams and studies, and am known to be friends with inertia
            the second I pass the acceptable mark.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">All of the above, however, might be sufficient to explain why I had only been to his
            office hours four times in 109 days. Never had I ever left his office with joy, but that’s because I was a
            terrible student, not because he was a terrible instructor.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">Out of the four afternoons that I loitered in his room, two of them were especially
            memorable. One was when I learned that I got a 30 out of 50 on my second exam on April 8th. I was sunk in a
            whirlpool of anxiety that day, because I knew I had screwed up my second exam. Wearing an additional layer
            probably explained why his office felt unusually hot that afternoon, but I made sure I remained contained,
            polite, and aloof. It took about a minute for him to rummage through Gradescope to find my score, and I
            remember leaning forward to take a closer look at the tiny “30/50” on his huge monitor. Instantly, I said,
            “Yeah, I expected that to happen. I had limited time to prepare for everything. Sorry.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">He was so kind. He replied, “No, it’s not a bad score.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">Then we were both subdued to a one-minute silence that felt like forever. I think I just
            froze there, feeling that jacket I pulled on last minute strangling my throat and squeezing out sweat on my
            forehead. I was blushing, but not for long, because he probably noticed, and said,
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Do you want to vent?”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">Again, I wasted no time responding calmly. “No, no, I’m not a venting type of person.
            Besides, I think I know where I went wrong. It’s just I thought I performed slightly better, but now I know
            I did not. I should set aside more time for test prep in the final exam.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I wasn’t lying for a single bit. I am not a venting type of person. Writing is my only
            form of ventilation. Hence, this passage.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I left his office, still blushing slightly, but just as I thought I was left safely on my
            own to reflect on my unbearable mishap, something wild happened.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Jerry!”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I looked back. He had left his office and is now standing steps away. I froze in the
            middle of the hallway, but unflinchingly I replied,
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Yes, professor?”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">He looked at me with concern in his eyes. “I don’t want you to feel bad. It’s really not a
            bad score.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">Again, I replied fast. “No, no, I’m not feeling bad at all. I know what to work on next.
            Thank you, professor.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Okay then.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Have a nice day.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“You too.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I guess what I thought was emotionless wasn’t emotionless enough. I must have looked
            dreadful in his office. So I started revisiting the frames of short-term memory with me standing in his
            office. Was it something I said? Was it something I did? I must have said something outrageous because I am
            certain that I didn’t do anything; the whole time I was so stiff I didn’t move and kept my hand locked to my
            body.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I truly believe that afternoon transformed his image in my head. At least he did feel a
            little less detached. Or maybe it’s because I had expected a lot less from a college professor.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">The second afternoon, on the other hand, was less distraught for me. I got stuck in a lab
            assignment.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">So why didn’t I go to an office hour with Teaching Assistants and choose to go to the
            professor’s? Answer: there was no office hour with Teaching Assistants that I could go to that day, and I
            didn’t want to wait any longer. As for why I couldn’t wait, I can’t remember; knowing me, I probably didn’t
            finish the lab on time or something.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">So there we were, looking for clues to solve the last puzzle in a lab assignment about
            string methods in C. I should state I wasn’t a total failure, though; I did solve the first 9 puzzles
            myself.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">And as we stood there scrutinizing lines of C code, I heard a loud crash from the left
            side of his desk, and my heart skipped a beat. What appeared to be a microphone set had collapsed and
            disconnected from the table, but at that instant, I saw a pile of black metal falling down.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I was too shocked to say anything.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Oh, that’s just the microphone.” He didn’t seem disturbed at all. Then he added,
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Everything is falling apart.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I was still dumbfounded but half of me know he was just murmuring out some exaggeration
            that I should ignore. So I did. The other half of me wasn’t so cooperative, though. Should I be vigilant of
            my surroundings? Is the end near for me?
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">Of course, those intrusive thoughts were shut down in a blink. We proceeded to go through
            the rest of the program till we found the answer.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">But his words kept ringing in my ears like some harbinger of dark tides. I started
            preparing for exams about his class weeks in advance, going to office hours as often as I could, even
            digging up corners of the internet for enlightenment on function pointers. If it weren’t for his warning, I
            probably wouldn’t have scored 96 out of 100 in the final exam.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">So, to close, I just wanted to say that while I am well aware classes in the future will
            be, to quote another instructor in the Computer Science department, “exponentially tougher,” I will cherish
            the fact that I met a teacher mystical enough to make the course seem rough but kind enough to make me look
            less like an idiot.
        </p>
        <hr>

        <p class="i-subtitle">On Recent Events</p>
        <p class="text-n">
            One day before being hit by the devastating news of Jim Ryan's resignation as the President of the
            University of Virginia, I was at lunch with a friend and said, “A fatal wart of people my age is that too
            often we support things we don’t fully understand.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">What happened 15 hours ago should be enough to prove that I was fundamentally wrong. There’s
            nothing hard to grasp here – no ideologies that require a translation or concepts that are esoteric – the
            President of my school and my beloved community was forced out of our grounds, facing pressure from the
            Trump administration and the Department of Justice’s orders to place a civil investigation of the University
            of Virginia.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">Unable to catch up with all the details leading to this upsetting blow, I am left with a
            sudden surge of angst and disgust. I have been meaning to write down many of what I’m about to say since the
            morning of November 6, 2024, but out of repeated fear of reprehension and forestalling from my loved ones, I
            have never been able to get my message across:
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">The activism we have been referring to, endorsed by initiatives including but not limited to
            the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, that have been publicly disdained and deemed a
            threat to the development of the United States by the Republican Party and its leader, Donald Trump, are not
            a choice or an impediment. It is a value one must uphold to maintain basic human decency.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">The activism we have been referring to, highlighting the principle that was, ironically,
            outlined in the Bible as “love thy neighbor,” is the bare minimum of helping the underrepresented
            communities when they are forced to continue the drudgery of living paycheck to paycheck under a world
            dominated by the privileged. It was never missing from the history of the United States, always found and
            expressed in different deafening voices throughout history, from the Declaration of Independence to the
            Civil Rights Act of 1964, and it should, in light of recent events, also be defiantly clear that such
            “activism” will never be erased.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">The activism we have been referring to, now threatened to be undermined on the grounds of the
            University of Virginia by the untenable claims and disguises of “civil investigation,” is no more than a
            tyrant and its puppets’ textbook attempt at suppressing the ideas of free speech and magnifying bias and
            discrimination on a land occupied by people who are guided by the search of higher levels of educational
            enrichment, critical thinking, and, most importantly, the exchange, the indulgence, and the appreciation of
            cultural differences, instead of people who hold the sounds of “anti-intellectualism” dear and worship God
            the way God would have loathed.

        <p class="text-n">To quote the words of Martin Luther King Jr., “Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light
            can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.” I have infiltrated this reflection of
            recent events with darkness, to which I apologize, but I do not regret one bit of etching the reflection out
            so people can see. I must close now, but I hope this call wakes you up, whoever you may be.

        <p class="text-n">
            One thing I learned in recent years is that for expedient matters, don’t be patient. Be desperate. Express
            this desperation to whom it may concern unflinchingly. There is a fine line between being desperate and
            being delusional, however. Let’s not wish for stuff that takes generational effort to alter, like social
            status, wealth, and genetic decency.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">And that is why I chose writing as a means of expressing my desperation. I never even thought
            about being vociferous in any place other than on paper. Writing, for me, feels like the closest I can get
            to an NDE (Near-Death Experience) without harming myself. Every time I write about a revelation, that
            revelation exits my body and gets tucked between the pages of some book that I’ll never read again. That is,
            unless my memories blow a strong wind across the room and flip the book open again.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">Don’t you just hate it when that happens? Way past your breaking point but not a single tear
            is even wandering around your eye, and you wonder to yourself, “when did crying become a luxury?”

        <p class="text-n">It’s baffling to me how humbling what has been frequently dubbed as the most famous street in
            the world appears when you actually set foot on it. Hollywood Walk of Fame, located north of Los Angeles,
            was and still is a place that I wouldn’t even dare to include in my dreams. But on a Tuesday morning, I had
            the opportunity to make myself a part of the mythical land ad hoc.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">And I wouldn’t have noticed what the streets looked like ahead if I hadn’t heard a soft and
            oscillating chant sweep past my shoulder.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“The… party… continues!” I watched a man, probably in his mid-20s, drifting toward me. He was
            very much drifting from my perspective because there was no way a conscious person strides with such
            confidence, nonchalance, and instability. His body was wobbling up and down, presumably like a seahorse. He
            was holding a giant bottle of beer in his hand, and that hand was anything but steady. The bottle was
            occasionally flung into the air, and just as you watched it float and free-fall, shivered and waited to hear
            a loud crash, it always landed back in his hand.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I was concerned but not scared. People do that all the time, I told myself. You’re in the
            States, I told myself. Gladly, the light turned green on the nearest crosswalk, and I quickly walked to the
            other side of the street before he could spot me, hurriedly, with my head down the whole time.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">Tuesday morning, for god’s sake. The rain had just turned to a light shower. No one should be
            on the streets. Spring break for schools on the West Coast doesn’t start until a week later, so students
            shouldn’t be around these streets; no sane employer would set up a workplace on a street with the highest
            imaginable rent in LA just for exposure, so we could rule employed people out of the way as well. We’re left
            with two types: students and the unemployed.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I was both. I was there. I looked up, and sure enough, only a few were walking around. But
            what surprised me was how the street resembled The Corner at Charlottesville. Same black-colored shops
            selling posters and costumes, with a few brown-walled restaurants occasionally stuck between them like
            bookmarks. Even fewer were the white-tinted vendors, selling drinks and vape. To the right of the sidewalk
            was a road for vehicles. Two lanes were set for each direction. That’s only one more than The Corner. And
            the buildings were mediocre, too. None of them exceeds three stories, and they all could really use some
            repolishing on the outside.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">Traces of fame and prosperity, I’d argue, were only evident in three aspects: the pine trees,
            the billboards, and random people’s names carved on a star-shaped brick on the floor. “Those were no random
            people,” you’d likely correct me, “those were celebrities.” Well, that’s what I thought as well until I had
            to walk for five minutes before seeing Jennifer Lopez right outside the south exit of Hollywood/Highland
            Station. Then, another ten minutes before I saw RuPaul with diamonds embedded around his television badge
            under his name, another fifteen before I saw Martin Scorsese.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">That sentiment changed when I stood in front of the Dolby Theatre, however. It was probably
            one of the only things that matched my expectations.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Live from the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood & Highland, it’s the Oscars! And now, ladies and
            gentlemen, please welcome your host for the evening, Jimmy Kimmel!”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I’ve always wondered why Kimmel got the hosting gig so many times until I turned and saw the
            banners of Jimmy Kimmel Live hanging right across the street. That’s where they tape the show?! I thought
            they had a studio in the headquarters of ABC Network. Maybe I’ve watched too much SNL.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">Under a brightened but still grayish sky, the Dolby Theatre didn’t fail to emit its golden
            glow on the façade of its gate. It looked a little smaller, but that was probably because I was looking from
            a distance. So I crossed the street again and stopped in front of the Theatre.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">It could be the rain or the lack of tourists, but I still felt something was missing. The
            architectural language of a rectangular gate didn’t express much other than showing up in various cameos of
            the red carpet they have every year. So I decided to walk inside.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">Even the ceiling light was off. The staircase was admittedly elegant, and the décor on the
            ceiling, columns, and walls was deluxe, but no more than a Grand Hyatt you’d find in the CBD in Beijing.
            Walking up the staircase, I finally couldn’t go any further. It amazed me how I’ve come this far and no one
            even tried to intervene. That was it, and I was grateful. I could always catch a glimpse of what’s inside
            when I rewatch the 89th Oscars, where Justin Timberlake led the cameraman all the way to the stage when
            singing I’ve Got This Feeling. So I walked away from the locked doors showing a dark interior.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">And don’t even get me started on the TCL Chinese Theatre on the west of the Dolby Theatre. The
            only thing Chinese about the TCL Chinese Theatre was the two guardian stone lions sitting in front of the
            door, which were drowned by the lone lines of moviegoers outside the gate. On god I swear you’ll never find
            that pagoda design on any architecture in China. The flying eaves on the already traumatic pagoda were so
            thin and sharp they looked more like antennae. A later googling told me that the interior of the Theatre
            would have changed my mind a little. But it wasn’t like I had the time or money for a ticket to the
            screening of a recently released movie that I was likely not interested in, so I didn’t go inside.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">Interestingly, the sarcasm between the lines in this recollection of my morning trip to the
            Hollywood Walk of Fame never presented itself at any moment while I was physically there. I did feel like
            something was missing, but I thought it was me.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I missed the lottery of living a bedazzling life engulfed in the power and delight of fame and
            wealth. I missed the chance of daydreaming so hard that I convinced my parents I should pursue a career in
            directing or acting. I missed the chance of choosing the road not taken that would have made me stand among
            the pink, golden A-listers with their names engraved on the ground, without sinking into a strong but hollow
            realization that even though I was finally walking in a dreamscape, there was and always will be a
            million-mile gap between me and the glamour this place crowns. I was there physically, not viscerally.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">But as I walked back to the metro station and looked around to see the unflattering buildings,
            I remembered how much of the entire Hollywood Boulevard reminded me of the streets back at school.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I stared at the stars along the street. Then the shops. I just noticed how no shop was
            promoting any visits or mentions from the celebrities.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I like the shops more.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I looked back at those Theatres.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">You definitely would despise someone unappealing like me, I thought. But today, I’m returning
            that despise to you.
