        <p class="text-n">
            A man in a plaid shirt and jeans stood in front of a desk.</p>
        <p class="text-n">“Before we begin today’s session, I’d like us all to try to recall -”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">He turned to draw a little question mark on the blackboard.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“The first question we’ve ever asked in our entire lives.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">And he added a little circle around the question mark. Then he stepped away from the desk and
            started strolling around the room. “Now, I know for most of us, the first thing that comes to mind would be
            a lot of ‘why’s. But is there something other than that ‘why’? Or what triggered us to understand the logic
            behind that thing we didn’t understand when we were little?”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">It took me some minutes before finally tracing back a memory lane that wasn’t a dead-end
            street. I think I might be four or five then.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“That’s a news reporter, Jerry.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Does he sell balloons?”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“No.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“He should try selling balloons. They are really popular.”

        <p class="i-subtitle">A Wanderer’s Journal</p>
        <p class="text-n">By my last day in San Francisco, I had visited the places and faces I had planned for my trip
            to California, and my afternoon was surprisingly free. My dad had been to the United States once and told me
            about Fisherman’s Wharf and the Golden Gate. I had heard about the latter myself repeatedly – one of the
            countless hallmarks of America.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">The whole trip felt like walking into the sweetest dreams I’ve had in my life. Los Angeles had
            been legendary, just like the legends about it. To this day I don’t know what I did to deserve the sunset at
            Griffith Observatory and reuniting with old-timey acquaintances. I asked my headphones to play Lana Del Rey
            nonstop for days, and they gladly obeyed. My loved ones always say I’m a simple kid. Send me off to an
            interesting place and provide me with basic housing and nutrition, and I’ll be smiling ear to ear. The place
            has to be interesting, though: it’s unlikely I’ll see myself joyfully going through my days at somewhere
            embroiled with stress and uneasiness.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">On that bright-colored afternoon, I thought my phone and I could make it to the Golden Gate
            through public transit. Didn’t fully move on from the convenience of Metro LA, I guess. I took multiple
            turns, got to a bus stop, and waited for half an hour. The bus, as I had expected, never came. These cities’
            bus schedules never really accord with what Google Maps says. I was halfway to the destination and thought
            maybe the Uber would be cheaper now that I’ve spent all this time walking around aimlessly. I pulled out my
            phone. It wasn’t, still $12. The driver kindly dropped me off at a vast park for a better view, which I
            later learned is the Fort Point National Historic Site. I opened the car door and walked into the sea salt
            air and cool gushes of wind.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">It was March 14th. Springtime was dancing on her heels, glittering with chills. People were
            gathering around the fences that kept them safe from the ocean’s grip, some were fishing. That’s what a
            normal guy would say; what I saw was – and pardon me for sounding dramatic – the austere men and women
            standing in their unblemished white gowns between soft and glowing heaven clouds, and the sunlight was
            hugging everyone close. Even taking a step felt surreal at that moment.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">The waves became louder as I approached their accepting arms. I finally came to an extension
            bridge that stretches a little further into the ocean, and stood there. Snow or even sand was nowhere in
            sight, but I swear I saw Joel Barish and Clementine Kruczynski tugging each other.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">And I thought, boy, I could die here. I’ve never felt more loved. More helpless yet worriless.
            I know I have unfinished studies and unfinished business, but I was subdued and I issued them an apology. I
            need to be buried. Under these waves or afloat like a little buoy. I wasn’t just smiling ear to ear anymore,
            I was fulfilled to the very best. Not like I ever thought this moment of fulfillment and ultimate pleasure
            could last or anything, instead I very much prepared myself for its termination. But for that afternoon, it
            didn’t. I was wafting through memories and familiar faces I travelled hundreds of miles to see days earlier,
            how most of them never really changed and became my savior or secret crush.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">Then like the waves, the image of them became pellucid and collapsed into the distance. I was
            there, alone but still delighted.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I walked along the Historic Site, my head playing Everything I Wanted by Billie Eilish on
            repeat. In an interview, she said she had a nightmare where she jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge and the
            news came out the next day with the headline “Annoying Girl Finally Killed Herself.” (Again, pardon me for
            not remembering her exact words correctly.) Everybody who saw the news cheered. She woke up and decided to
            write the song, but what she conceived was initially sandboxed due to its darkness. On an information board
            erected somewhere near the Fort Point, from 2000 to 2005, every two weeks, a person jumps off the bridge.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I was more sad than appalled to see this statistic. For so many of us, life has been the
            antithesis of easy, and the world has been the opposite of kind. We need to let a lot go. The world sucks,
            so keep in mind that we can suck too. Let’s be less harsh on ourselves than people who know nothing about
            us.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">As I walked back, I felt compelled to document all of this. It felt so real and tangible as
            long as it was not written down. I have the pictures, I said to myself. It’s been delineated in the back of
            my mind, so I’ll let it stay that way.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">Want to hear something fun? In my wanderer’s journal, I have kept all the pictures from my
            trip to California, all except my afternoon spent at the Golden Gate.
        </p>
        <hr>

        <p class="i-subtitle">Excision</p>
        <p class="text-n">I think someone barged into my room last night. Saxophone-shaped device in one hand, a pipette
            in another, he was standing in a long white coat that would’ve looked completely normal if it wasn’t
            covering his abnormally huge calloused hands and his intimidating torso. He’s probably the type of man you
            see on the streets and immediately want to walk away from. I know I would.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">Then he pointed the saxophone-shaped device at my unconscious, cold body on the bed. He was
            visibly trembling as if this were his first time. He slid the pipette into his pocket and positioned both
            his hands on the saxophone. In the silence of the night, he softly blew into the sax and started playing
            Waltz II from The Suite for Jazz Orchestra No. 2. One of my favorites.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">Just as he was about to finish, I yawned and pulled the sheets up over my head. Turning
            around, I noticed the music playing from the side of my bed had stopped, and a tall figure was looming over
            me.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">And I mumbled, “Hey, you.” Then I fell asleep.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">But he didn’t leave. There was about an hour where he probably just watched me sleep like a
            psychopath, according to the security camera footage. Then he finally lost his patience and grabbed my hand.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Hey. Wake the hell up, buddy. You said you’d help me move out, remember?”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I pulled my hand back from his suffocating grip. “I did. I also checked the time, and it
            appears to be 02:40 in the morning. Let’s take you to a hospital because clearly some meds need to be
            taken.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“I know. I just couldn’t sleep. Come on, it’ll be fun.” His smile in the dark looked like a
            smirk.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“You do know I just called you a psycho, right?”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">On a hot and humid summer night, he pulled me into his car.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Why would you need me to help you anyway?” I closed the car door and fastened the seatbelt.
            “You’re like the fittest person I’ve ever met. I’m the opposite. We’re not close friends. We probably aren’t
            even friends. We only meet in my dreams.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Exactly.” He started the engine, and we veered off into the street.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“I’m gonna sue you someday.” I rolled my eyes.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">We got to his place at 03:17. Boy, when I tell you his place looked every bit like what I had
            in mind – a hot mess, a fluorescent junkyard, a combination of lamenting juxtapositions. I reasonably
            loathed it because someone once told me I was, quote, “too tidy to be a boy.” Oh, wait, that’s him. He told
            me that.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Did you even start packing?” I refused to step inside and slapped my forehead in dismay.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">He shook his head.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Do you know what packing means?”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">He sneered. “Of course I do.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Ok then. Tell me what it means.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">He just pointed to a pile of collapsed cardboard boxes on top of all this obscenity like an
            ogre.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">I had to scream so I did. “I’m not doing this, bro. You can look me straight in my eyes and
            tell me you’re gay and you want to fuck me and I’m still walking away from this room.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">An inquisitive look swept his face. “What if I – ”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“I’d be walking away regardless. Now – ” I walked to a corner of pizza boxes. “Send these to
            Joey Tribbiani or the garbage bins downstairs. These books here – oh god, you actually know how to read?” I
            was, indeed, shocked to my very core.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">He rolled his eyes. “I mean, that’s news. Mr. Reed knows how to read. Anyways, these books
            here are seemingly related to your major, which I assume would be biology?” I looked at him and he nodded.
            “Very well then. All biology books should be in a box, and all the other books – ” I walked around the room,
            sidestepping suspicious boxes of dark unknown, “ – are nonexistent. So. How about you put the books away
            first, and we work on the next category, which is…” Trying to find a pattern in the tumultuous room, I
            finally said, “clothes.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">He collected the books, and I sat there doing nothing except making commands. When asked about
            why, I answered simply, “The choice of inviting an out-of-shape friend at 2 a.m. to help pack for someone
            who should be able to lift me in a gym is a questionable one, so much so that it’s in much more dire need to
            be justified than my idleness.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">When we were finally done, I asked a question that I never knew needed to be asked.
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“Where do you put all these boxes?”</p>
        <p class="text-n">“At your place.” He looked down at me.</p>
        <p class="text-n">My jaw dropped. “I don’t have a place.”</p>
        <p class="text-n">“Well, then, at your parents’ place.”</p>
        <p class="text-n">My jaw continued dropping. I stared at his stupid face blankly. “Did you, by any chance, get
            hit by a fucking car?”</p>
        <p class="text-n">“No.”</p>
        <p class="text-n">“Because I really need you to be. What do you fucking mean? How in the world would my parents
            even agree?”</p>
        <p class="text-n">“I talked with them.”</p>
        <p class="text-n">I knew I blushed, and I was starting to lose consciousness. “You talked with my parents about
            storing your shit at their place and they said yes?”</p>
        <p class="text-n">“Yes.”</p>
        <p class="text-n">“Ok then. When my parents wake up this morning, I hope they won’t be surprised at this surge
            of boxes around their house, because if they do, you’re definitely going behind bars.”</p>
        <p class="text-n">On the drive home, I started getting sleepy but managed to be sober enough to ask the two most
            important questions that I require an answer to.</p>
        <p class="text-n">I turned to him. “Tell me something, Reed. Why do you always come to me for stuff like this?”
        </p>
        <p class="text-n">“What do you mean?” He kept his eyes on the road.</p>
        <p class="text-n">“Like appearing in my dreams and distorting all the things we’ve actually done together. You
            know you don’t trust me with your stuff. You know tonight has been my fabrication.”</p>
        <p class="text-n">There was a moment of silence. “I don’t know… I mean, it is your subconscious. So you’d
            probably know the answer before I do.”</p>
        <p class="text-n">“You’d think, wouldn’t you?” I uttered in exhaustion.</p>
        <p class="text-n">“Will you ever leave me alone? Please? For my sanity?”</p>
        <p class="text-n">Our car arrived at my parents’ house. “That’s overblown. How does my presence equal your
            insanity?”</p>
        <p class="text-n">“It does. I met you four years ago. This is the fifth time I’ve written about you in my
            compositions. You’ve come to me in my sleep for, I don’t know, twenty times now. You’re not gay. I had a
            major secret crush on you, and now we’re on different coasts.”</p>
        <p class="text-n">“You did?” He said as we felt the elevator accelerate.</p>
        <p class="text-n">“Yes. I never told anyone except people who don’t judge me. They probably do judge me, but let
            them be.”</p>
        <p class="text-n">I unlocked the door and we tiptoed back to my room. “Seriously, Reed. I kept myself
            tongue-tied because I knew telling the truth would ruin both of our lives. But can you at least let me get
            over this before I actually feel the need to love somebody?”</p>
        <p class="text-n">He walked to the side of my bed and pulled out a little cup and a test tube filled with what
            appeared to be syrup. He took out the pipette and transferred a portion of the syrup from the tube to the
            cup. He sighed.</p>
        <p class="text-n">“I don’t know. It’s not like I can control what and who you dream about. But drink this.”</p>
        <p class="text-n">I looked at the cup. “Listen, Reed, if I was found dead shortly after this – ”</p>
        <p class="text-n">“It’s not poison, okay?”</p>
        <p class="text-n">I drank it. “It’s something I made for you that would probably help.”</p>
        <p class="text-n">“Thanks.” I looked outside. Gently but surely, light is gathering and brightening the sky.
            “It’s getting late. The day is dawning. I guess, uh, I’ll see you around. Not here, though.”</p>
        <p class="text-n">“Thank you for helping me move out. Goodbye!”</p>
        <p class="text-n">He slid the pipette into his pocket and, locating his sax that was lying against the wall,
            positioned both his hands on the saxophone. In the silence of the dawn, he took a deep breath.</p>
        <p class="text-n">I was on the bed, eyes closed, fatigued, waiting for the sound of Waltz II. But nothing
            happened. As I turned around, I slowly opened my eyes.</p>
        <p class="text-n">He was gone.</p>
